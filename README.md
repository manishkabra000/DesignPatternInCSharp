# 🎯 Design Patterns in C# (.NET)

A hands-on, practical implementation of the most common **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** design patterns using C# and .NET.

This repository is designed for:

- 📘 Learning design patterns through code
- 🧪 Practicing object-oriented principles in C#
- 💼 Interview preparation

## 📂 Project Structure

```
DesignPatternsInCSharp/
├── DesignPatterns.ConsoleApp/
│   ├── Creational/       # Singleton, Factory, etc.
│   ├── Structural/       # Adapter, Composite, etc.

Each design pattern is implemented in its own `.cs` file, grouped under its corresponding category.
